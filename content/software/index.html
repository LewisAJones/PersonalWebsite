<p>The palaeoverse R package is a community-driven toolkit to support the preparation and exploration of palaeobiological data. The package provides a suite of auxiliary functions, is open-source, and freely available from the <span style="color: #ed4d7e"><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palaeoverse/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">CRAN</a></span>. palaeoverse has three core principles: (1) streamline data preparation and exploration; (2) enhance code readability; and (3) improve reproducibility of results. It is my hope that over time, palaeoverse will be adopted and developed by the community, with contributors and users from across the globe.</p>
