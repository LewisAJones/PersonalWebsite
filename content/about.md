I am a **computational palaeobiologist** investigating the drivers of biodiversity patterns across a range of temporal and spatial scales. My research primarily focuses on the co-evolution of life and the environment in deep time, and evaluating the influence of data incompleteness on our perceptions of the geological past. To do so, I integrate a range of interdisciplinary tools and sources of information, such as **ecological niche modelling, fossil occurrence data, and palaeoclimatic models** to estimate species' distributions in deep time. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Mapas Lab](https://paleobiogeography.org) at the University of Vigo, where I study the **constraints and drivers of spatial biodiversity patterns** in the fossil record. 

To date, my research has primarily focused on marine invertebrates, particularly **scleractinian corals and warm-water coral reefs**. However, I also collaborate with numerous fantastic researchers on projects related to the **[non-avian dinosaurs](https://alessandrochiarenza.weebly.com)**, **[mammals](https://www.mirantakouvari.com)**, and **[palaeoclimate](https://keichenseer.netlify.app/)** really check them out!
