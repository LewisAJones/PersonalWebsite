I am a <strong>computational palaeobiologist</strong> investigating the drivers of biodiversity patterns across a range of temporal and spatial scales. My research primarily focuses on the co-evolution of life and the environment, and evaluating the influence of data incompleteness on our perceptions of the geological past. To do so, I integrate a range of interdisciplinary tools and sources of information, such as <strong>ecological niche modelling, fossil occurrence data, and palaeoclimatic models</strong> to estimate species’ distributions in deep time. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the <strong><a href="https://paleobiogeography.org">Mapas Lab</a></strong> at the University of Vigo, where I study the <strong>constraints and drivers of spatial biodiversity patterns</strong> in the fossil record.

To date, my research has primarily focused on marine invertebrates and ecosystems, particularly <strong>scleractinian corals and warm-water coral reefs</strong>. I also collaborate with numerous fantastic researchers on projects related to the <strong><a href="https://alessandrochiarenza.weebly.com">non-avian dinosaurs</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.mirantakouvari.com">mammals</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://keichenseer.netlify.app/">palaeoclimate</a></strong>, check them out!
